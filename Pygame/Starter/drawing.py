#Rect Objects
"""
Pygame has two ways to represent rectangular areas (just like there are two ways to represent colors). The first is a tuple of four integers:

1.      The X coordinate of the top left corner.
2.      The Y coordinate of the top left corner.
3.      The width (in pixels) of the rectangle.
4.      Then height (in pixels) of the rectangle.

The second way is as a pygame.Rect object, which we will call Rect objects for short.
